# Tabellion Components Overview

In Tabellion, we have developed the client side on HiKey development board and Nexus 5X smartphone and the server side in an Azure VM.
For the client side, we have implemented the secure primitives (secure photo, secure screenshot, secure timestamp) using the HiKey development board.
We have developed an Android Application for the user study.

We will first cover the implementation on the HiKey board.
Next, we will introduce the Android app and the server side.
